#+title: Score Voting

Score voting is a [[id:895de7be-5ff8-477a-96d7-3bdc0376f248][Voting System]] where a voter may score each candidate on a predefined scale. They may give multiple candidates the same score or give some none at all.

* Flaws

In this scenario, blue wins when using any voting method other than approval and score. While this scenario feels unfair, in practice a third party would likely align themselves with the majority view. Generated using https://ncase.me/ballot/sandbox/sandbox.html
