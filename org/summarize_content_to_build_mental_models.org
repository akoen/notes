#+title: Summarize content to build mental models

When you read a book, listen to a podcast, or otherwise consume content made by experts, it is vital to summarize and rework their ideas into your own words. This allows you to:
1. Inhabit their mind by imitating their thought patterns and language.
2. Build durable neural connections by [[file:elaboration.org][§Elaborating]] on what you read.
3. [[file:books/show_your_work.org][§Show Your Work]] with others to engage them in a conversation.
