- tags :: [[file:hydrogen.org][Â§Hydrogen]]

- Unlike a heat engine, fuel cells are not limited by the Carnot efficiency. cite:shell

- High-temperature fuel cells such as the solid-oxide fuel cell can make use a combined heat and power process (CHP), leading to higher efficiencies.

* Types of fuel cells

- In general as the operating temperature of the fuel cell increases, the purity of hydrogen required decreases cite:shell.

** Proton-exchange membrane fuel cell cite:shell

- Are the most applicable to the transportation sector,
  - Expensive due to a platinum catalyst.
  - Operates with air rather than pure oxygen.
  - Highest potential for cost reduction. Expected to achieve 30 $/kWel (kilowatt electric), which is comparable to ICEs.

** Solid oxide fuel cell cite:shell

- The second most important type of fuel cell.
- More efficient than the PEMFC, but hindered due to high start-up times.
- Applicable to power plants and home energy.
