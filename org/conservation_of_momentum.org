#+title: Conservation of Momentum

- tags :: [[file:physics.org][§Physics]]
  
- The conceptualization of the conservation of momentum marked the transition from pre-modern to modern physics.

- Because momentum is a vector, and not a scalar like [[file:energy.org][§Energy]],  it is easier to observe experimentally.
  - For example, in an inelastic collision, momentum is conserved but kinetic energy is not.
