#+title: Conservation of Momentum

- tags :: [[id:83a06686-dab0-46f9-98ab-1c10e4afacb8][§Physics]]
  
- The conceptualization of the conservation of momentum marked the transition from pre-modern to modern physics.

- Because momentum is a vector, and not a scalar like [[id:fc3b6b42-307e-4dcd-a01d-a3e579764238][§Energy]],  it is easier to observe experimentally.
  - For example, in an inelastic collision, momentum is conserved but kinetic energy is not.
