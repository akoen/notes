#+title: Ambient Privacy

Ambient [[file:digital_privacy.org][Â§privacy]] is a term coined by Maciej Ceglowski which encapsulates the idea that there is value in having the small details of our daily lives be forgotten.

- There should not be a record of our private conversations or what we do when we're home by ourselves.
