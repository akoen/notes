#+title: Procrastination

- Procrastination is not a result of boredom, it's a consequence of not knowing exactly what you should be doing in the moment.
  - For example, maybe you know that you should be working on your research paper. This is a monumental task, and it is easier to open Instagram than to grapple with such a vague responsibility.
  - Conversely, if you decided beforehand that the /next/ task required for your paper is to record six notes for a specific scholarly article, you would have no problem executing. [[file:modularize_your_life.org][Â§Modularize Your Life]]
  - *Strive to reduce friction between tasks.*

- As soon as you start to work on the problem at hand, your fear of failure goes down because you can influence the outcome.
