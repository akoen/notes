  The thesis of Austin Kleon's book /Show Your Work/ is that [[file:../learning_in_public.org][§Learning in Public]] is the most effective way to learn faster and gain an audience.

* Notes

- All of the most influential creative people incorporate sharing into their work.
  - For example, [[file:../tiago_forte.org][§Tiago Forte]] and [[file:../ali_abdaal.org][§Ali Abdaal]] always share what courses they are taking, what projects they are working on etc.
- Surround yourself with others with whom you can share and compare work. This could be in person on or on the internet.
  - Find niches.

- We are not drawn to art, we are drawn to the stories behind works of art. This is why a copy of a painting is never as beautiful as the original work.
