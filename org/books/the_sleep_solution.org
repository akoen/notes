#+TITLE: The Sleep Solution

* Ideas

- We have four primary drives: the drives to eat, drink, sleep, and procreate.
  - Unlike the other drives, however, we do not have a choice about whether or not to sleep. When we become tired enough, our body will force sleep upon us, whether we like it or not.

- *The difference between sleepy and fatigues:*

  - Sleepy :: when your body wants to sleep.

  - Fatigued :: when your body is low on energy e.g. after a hard day of exercise.

  - It is easy to confuse the two. If we go to bed when we are fatigued, but not sleepy, we will lie awake.

- *6 â€“ 7 hours of sleep are typically adequate. Those who struggle with sleep believe they need more because their sleep quality is poor.*

- There are two regulatory systems that drive sleep:

  1. The homeostatic system of sleep (the system that urges us to sleep the longer we stay awake) is driven by adenosine.
     - Caffeine inhibits adenosine

  2. The circadian rhythm system of sleep is driven by melatonin.
