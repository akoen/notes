* Notes

- Software rot—a project's slow but inevitable decline into disarray—is caused by a single entropy source.
  - This is [[file:../broken_windows_theory.org][§Broken Windows Theory]]

  - *Fix small bugs immediately.*

- Continually invest in your knowledge portfolio:
  - Aim to learn at least one language a year.

  - Read technical books.

- Never duplicate information -> Remember the acronym DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). This applies to:
  - Code <–> Comments :: don't explain code that explains itself.

  - Code <–> Code :: always try to write modular components that can be re-used. Don't write a new function because it requires slightly different functionality than another function.

  - Code <–> Documentation :: when code is updated, documentation is often ignored. Consider how this could be mitigated. Could the code be generated from the documentation i.e. [[file:../literate_programming.org][§Literate Programming]]?

- Use getters and setters whenever possible to protect private values.
