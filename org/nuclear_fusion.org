#+title: Nuclear Fusion

- Fusion occurs when the nuclei of two atoms are forced close enough together that the attraction of the strong force overcomes the electromagnetic repulsion.
  - The kinetic-energy barrier required to achieve fusion is known as the Coulomb barrier
  - Requires a temperature of ~100 million K
