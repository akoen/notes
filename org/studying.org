#+title: Studying

- Personal observation: I experience the greatest sense of flow when I do not allow myself to make any mistakes: I keep repeating a problem until I do it right. *Make yourself fix your mistakes.*
  
* Retrospective revision
According to [[https://aliabdaal.com/retrospectiverevisiontimetables/][Ali Abdaal]], he finds it more productive to operate on a *retrospective* revision timetable rather than a prospective one. This works for two reasons:

1. Making a prospective timetable is a form of procrastination.
2. A retrospective timetable forces you to identify your weakest areas and study those.
