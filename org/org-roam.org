[[https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-roam][Org-Roam]] is an [[file:emacs.org][§Emacs]] package which tries to emulate the behaviour of [[https://roamresearch.com/][Roam Research]] in emacs.

* Advantages of org-roam
1. Notes are stored in a flat hierarchy. This minimizes the cognitive demand of trying to organize complex information (this is delegated to creating links).
2. Org-roam implements [[file:zettelkasten.org][§Zettelkasten]].
3. Like [[file:zettelkasten.org][§Zettelkasten]], org-roam /forces/ you to think about how the information contained within a note relates to other notes, resulting in enhanced learning. This is [[file:elaboration.org][§Elaboration]].
