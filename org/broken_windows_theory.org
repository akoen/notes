#+title: Broken Windows Theory

- Broken Windows Theory is a criminology theory which observes that signs of minor criminal activity that have not been taken care of  (like broken windows, for example), leads to a spike in crime.

- "Broken windows" present the appearance of apathy.

- This is extended to explain why minor unresolved bugs in [[file:programming.org][Â§Programming]] projects can lead to the entire project's demise or why a few dirty dishes left in the sink can lead to the house's decline into disarray.

- The solution is to clean up the visible signs of disorder.
