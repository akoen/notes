#+title: Consistency

- No one ever failed in life because they weren't good enough; they failed because they gave up.

  #+begin_quote
  "Greatness is consistency.
  Meditating once is common. Meditating daily is rare.
  Exercising today is simple. Training every week is simply remarkable.
  Writing one essay rarely matters. Write every day and you're practically a hero.
  Unheroic days can make for heroic decades."
