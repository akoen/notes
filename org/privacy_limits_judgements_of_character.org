#+title: Privacy limits judgements of character

- Put simply, your privacy is important because it limits the power of governments and corporations to make judgments about your character. (see [[id:20a8b435-ae34-45cc-9dab-84aab85d91aa][The importance of privacy]])
  - These judgments, which may be inaccurate or biased, can then be used to make decisions about youâ€”to selectively grant or deny you opportunities.
