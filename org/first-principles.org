#+TITLE: First Principles

- In his [[https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html][article]] on [[file:tesla.org][§Tesla]], [[file:tim_urban.org][§Tim Urban]] compares knowledge to a tree: if you don't have a solid trunk of information on which to scaffold new ideas, the "branches" will fall down.
  - This is echoed by [[file:michael_nielsen.org][§Michael Nielsen]] in [[file:websites/article_augmenting_long_term_memory.org][§Article: Augmenting Long-term Memory]], who claims that people need to spend more time focusing on the basic before worrying about complex issues.
  
- This way of thinking is shared by many successful entrepreneurs such as [[file:elon_musk.org][§Elon Musk]] and [[file:steve_jobs.org][§Steve Jobs]]
  - *When Jobs was designing the iPhone, he asked "What should a mobile phone be?" instead of "How do we make a better blackberry."*

“My somewhat pious belief was that if people focused more on remembering the basics, and worried less about the “difficult” high-level issues, they'd find the high-level issues took care of themselves. ”
