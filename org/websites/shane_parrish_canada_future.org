#+title: Shane Parrish: What Canada should be doing

-  source :: https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1280159687393120256.html

- Build a trans-Canada fibre pipeline.

- Roll out 5g nationwide.

- Ensure reliable internet access for rural and remote areas.

- Build a domestic capability to create and manufacture microchips.

- Ensure digital literacy and skills for the future, including implementing mandatory coding classes from early primary to Grade 12. Teach [[id:690198da-5662-4141-a601-f93229f90675][§online privacy]] in all of these grades as well. (see [[id:cd1aa9a0-ca77-4cae-b880-17ebda7c2ae7][§What classes should be taught in school?]])

- Build a high-speed rail network, starting with Montreal-Ottawa-Toronto corridor.

- Repatriate critical know-how and manufacturing capabilities in key industries such as heath, aerospace, and silicon.

- Launch a targeted repatriation/[[id:f3cd67a4-6a90-4b16-aa3c-5e3a8df66006][§immigration]] program that would actively recruit and fund Canadians and non-Canadians living abroad with specific expertise to set up Canadian capabilities. (Pretend we run a sports team and recuit the best people to come build.)

- Implement a government matching loan program to provide interest-free matching loans from $2M to $10M to proven entrepreneurs in addition to an equity stake. E.g. Proven entrepreneur invests $10M of own capital, Gov matches with interest-free loan for 10 years and 5% equity.

- Rapidly scale up investments in [[id:c15f119b-dbc7-426c-a9fa-cc8f18d546dd][§Clean Energy]] infrastructure.

- Let's get started. It's time to build the future.
