Aspect orientated programming is a programming paradigm in which functionality may be added to existing code through the use of advice.

- For example, you could add logging functionality to a set of functions functions using a single line of code.
  
- AOP is generally considered to be antiquated and replaced by languages with built in support for such paradigms such as [[id:72280684-1ef9-43c0-8e67-77db5c44d5be][§Elisp]]'s advice-add function.
