* Advantages
- Fuel is cheap
- The life cycle [[file:emission_intensity.org][§GHG Intensity]] of nuclear is estimated to be ~12g CO₂/kWh ([[https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-iii.pdf#page=7][source]])

* Disadvantages

- Average construction time of 6 years.
- Difficult to turn off.
- Nuclear power plants depend on social capital. If public opinion sways such that citizens are uncomfortable with [[file:nuclear_energy.org][§Nuclear Energy]], the plant will shut down.
