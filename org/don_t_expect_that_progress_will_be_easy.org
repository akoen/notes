#+title: Don't expect that progress will be easy

Nowadays, society promotes the idea that it is possible to make progress easily by working strategically. This includes:
- Losing weight quickly by following an exotic diet.
- Gaining muscle with little effort by performing specific exercises.
- Mastering a skill by watching an online course.

This inflates people's expectations while masking the truth: progress is hard. It's going to take longer than you thought and require more energy than you thought to make /any/ measurable progress.

In his book [[file:books/atomic_habits.org][Â§Atomic Habits]], James Clear calls this phenomenon the /Plateau of Latent Potential/ and the initial period the /Valley of Disappointment/.

Progress is exponential, and until you cross the linear line that you expect to follow, you will always be disappointed. Only by following through with your habits and systems when they seem inconsequential will your reap the benefits of compounding growth.
