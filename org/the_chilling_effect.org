#+title: The Chilling Effect

The Chilling Effect is a consequence of the surveillance state where citizens begin to fear repercussions for exercising their fundamental rights, like free speech or the right to protest.

For example, a student might be afraid to attend a legal Black Lives Matter protest because they're afraid of being put on a list of "potential rioters".
