#+TITLE: Deep Work

- Creative output is not limited by a lack of inputs. It is limited by a lack of time spent contemplating and reworking important ideas.

- We must establish routines and systems to limit the amount of willpower required to maintain unbroken concentration.
  - For example, you could ban internet use or prohibit yourself from leaving your office. This way, you have no choice but to work, and you will not endure a constant mental battle with your willpower.
