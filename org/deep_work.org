- *Creative output is not limited by a lack of inputs. It is limited by a lack of time spent contemplating and reworking important ideas.*

- You must establish routines and systems to /structure/ your work and limit the amount of willpower required to maintain unbroken concentration.

  2. Infinite pools: Instagram, YouTube etc.
