#+title: NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies

* Definitions

- Hidden node :: a node that is neither an input nor an output node.
- Bias unit :: An input that is always set to 1. Can connect to any node /other/ than an input.

* Evolution

Composed of:
1. Selection
2. Crossover
3. Mutation

* Augmenting
We start with the smallest possible set of nodes containing inputs and outputs. This is called /minimal initialization/, and is a distinct advantage of NEAT.

The /bias/ can be thought of as a y-intercept to our network: it allows us to shift our output up or down.

* Mutations
** Mutate Add Connection

* Speciation

The compatibility distance \sigma between two genomes is given by:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
\sigma=\frac{c_{1}E}{N}+\frac{c_{2}D}{N}+c_{3}\cdot \bar{W}
\end{equation}

where:
$N$ is the number of genes in the larger genome.
$E$ is the number of excess genes.
$D$ is the number of disjoint genes.
$\bar{W}$ is the /average/ difference in weight between all matching connections, including disabled ones.
$c_1, c_2, c_3$ are hard-coded importance coefficients.

TODO It is unclear what "Number of genes" means, so I am doing number of nodes + number of connections.

* Adjusted Fitness

The paper defines the adjusted fitness of a particular genome as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2}
f'=\frac{f_i}{\sum_{j=1}^n sh(\sigma(i,j))}
\end{equation}

Where $sh$ evaluates to 1 if the two genomes are similar enough to be classified as the same specifies. Thus, this equation simplifies to:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:3}
f'=\frac{f_i}{N},
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the number of genomes in the species.
