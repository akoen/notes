#+TITLE: Two-Day Rule

- tags :: [[file:productivity.org][§Productivity]]

- The Two-Day Rule states that you are not allowed to skip a habit more than one-day in a row.

- Habits are formed through [[file:consistency.org][§Consistency]], but that doesn't mean that no improvement will occur if you don't perform them every day.

- This is an effective way of maintaining motivation, since people often give up if they miss a single day.
