James Turrell is one of my [[file:favourite_visual_artists.org][Â§Favourite Visual Artists]] famous for his exploration of the materiality of light.

Since 1979, he has worked almost exclusively on his /Roden Crater/
project, a volcanic cinder cone that he is retrofitting into a naked-eye observatory and an art installation.
