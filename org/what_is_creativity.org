#+title: What is Creativity?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“Creativity is just connecting things.”

A similar quote by the inventor of the Clojure programming language, Rich Hickey:
#+begin_quote
Design is separating into things that can be composed. (see [[id:a0220f3c-bd51-40fb-ad6b-714c63136d59][Simplicity]])

According to [[id:daaf7a0e-7b41-4929-a39e-4ea2c6a25fa6][Tiago Forte]], a common misconception is that creativity starts from nothing. In reality, creativity is about finding new connections between seemingly disparate ideas and extending them to make something new.
