#+title: How To Learn

[[https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/][David R. MacIver]] proposes a framework for quickly learning challenging concepts:

1. Find an easy version of whatever you find hard.
2. Modify the easy version so that it is as hard as the challenging thing in /exactly/ one way.
3. Practice the modified version until it is easy.
4. Repeat this process until the hard thing becomes easy.

While this framework is simple, it identifies a key point: the importance of tight [[file:feedback_loops.org][§Feedback Loops]] and [[file:deliberate_practice.org][§Purposeful/Deliberate Practice.]]

- When you learn, don't focus on getting it right. Instead, focus on /how/ you're performing. Then, target the /specific areas/ where you're performing poorly.
