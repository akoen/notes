#+TITLE: Optical Coherence Tomography

* Overview
- Optical coherence tomography consists of measuring the optical reflections of biological structures using low-coherence light. cite:optical
  - Ultrashort pulsed lasers and supercontinuum lasers are used, but less frequently than superluminescent diodes.

- coherence :: waves are described as *coherent* if they have the same waveform and are perfectly in phase.
  - In this context, incoherent means that broadband light is used, modelled as a Gaussian source.

- Optical image tomography is analogous to optical ultrasound. Multiple longitudinal scans are performed laterally to produce a two-dimension map of reflection sites in the scanned area. cite:optical

- Typically uses near-infrared light.

- A light source produces a beam of incoherent light that is split by a Michelson interferometer. The interference pattern produced by the interference between the light returning from the sample and the light returning from a reference mirror is then analyzed cite:optical.

- To produce a B-scan image, the sample is scanned laterally forming a cross-section of A-scan images.

- Each measurement produces an A-scan image, analogous to that of an ultrasound machine. To produce a 2D or 3D image, the image must be scanned in one or two lateral dimensions respectively.

** Time domain OCT (TD-OCT)

- Goal is to identify the /position/ of the scattering object.
  
- In time-domain OCT, the position of a movable mirror is adjusted, resulting in a burst pattern when the mirror and the object are equidistant from the detector.

  - A broadband source is used because maximal constructive interference is /only/ produced when the two are equidistant.
  - If monochromatic or 2-wavelength sources are used, the interference signal is periodic as a function of τ *and the location of the scattering object cannot be determined.*

** Fourier domain OCT (FD-OCT)

- The rate at which the measured reflectance changes as a function of depth varies with wavelength.
  - Red light (greater wavelength) modulates more slowly than blue light (shorter wavelength).
    
- When reflectance is then plotted as a function of wavenumber ṽ, the values of reflectance for different colours of light form sine waves.
  - The period of these sine waves encodes the depth of the scattering object.
  
- In spectral domain OCT, the position of the reference mirror is not changed.

- Instead, a spectrometer at the detector measures the amplitude of the interference pattern as a function of the wavenumber ṽ.

- A Fourier transform is then performed on the measured reflectance vs. wavenumber plot to determine the reflectance vs. depth.

  1. A Gaussian source as for time-domain OCT with a spectrometer. This is Spectral Domain OCT.
  2. A swept-source with a simple detector. A rapidly tunable laser emits a single intense wavelength at a time. This is Swept Source OCT.

- FD-OCT is almost always favoured over TD-OCT because of improved sensitivity as a result of reduced noise. cite:twenty

- Both the axial and lateral resolution of OCT are significantly greater than ultrasound, CT, MRI, and other commonly used imaging technologies.
  - These resolution are typically 5–20 µm

** Applications

- In 2014, 5.13 million OCT scans were performed in the US alone, making it one of the most common medical imaging procedures cite:Fauw.

- Optical coherence tomography is used most often in ophthalmology, but can be used wherever translucent tissues are found.
  - Effective in early detection of macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and other retinal diseases cite:aumann.

  - The ability of OCT to measure the thickness of retinal layers makes it uniquely suitable for glaucoma diagnosis.
    
  - First introduced in 1996, an opthalmic OCT device was first introduced to the market, but was unpopular because of the low resolution and slow speed of TD-OCT cite:aumann.
  - In 2006, SD-OCT devices were first introduced, and have become indispensable to many diagnosticians cite:aumann.

- Optical coherence tomography angiography is an angiography technique which uses OCT scans to image the vasculature of the eye in higher-definition than dye angiography and without the risk of dye injection cite:tan2018overview.

* Improvements

- In ophthalmology, the bottleneck lies not in performing OCT scans, but in diagnosing eye conditions and making appropriate referrals from these scans cite:Fauw.

- In 2018, researchers at Google's DeepMind proposed a neural network that could perform segmentation, diagnosis, and make referral recommendations based on 3D OCT scans with accuracy equal to or exceeding that of ophthalmologists cite:Fauw.
  - Their model was trained on only 14,884 scans and works on a wide-range of commercially available OCT scanners.

- Their model is composed of two neural networks, a supervised segmentation network which identifies tissues boundaries surround the macula—the central region of the retina—and a supervised classification network which makes diagnosis and referral decisions based on 14,884 scan-diagnosis training pairs.

- While their model shows promise, a randomized controlled trial will need to be performed to determine its effectiveness.
