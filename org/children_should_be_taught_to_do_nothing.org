#+title: Children should be taught to do nothing

In school, children are given tight schedules to follow like a NASA astronaut. They have little agency, and while they are faced with consequences for under-performing, in general they do not get to choose /what/ it is that they get to work on. To quote [[file:david_perell.org][§David Perell]], "If we want to raise healthy, high-agency children, we should give them the freedom to make decisions without removing them from the consequences of those decisions. Giving children agency now will help them avoid a dark cycle of work, pain, and reckless release in the future."

In the quest to bring widespread [[file:educational_reform.org][§Educational Reform]], schools should teach children to do nothing—to sit quietly with their thoughts and resist distraction.
