#+title: Base Load Electricity

Base load in the minimum demand on an electrical grid.

Base load power plants are those that can produce power continuously. Solar panels don't work at night and wind turbines don't work when the air is calm, yet cities must still be powered during those times.

This need is often used to dismiss renewable energy sources, which are often intermittent, as unreliable. Yet this may be shortsighted, since by sourcing energy from a diversity of renewables, countries like Iceland and Costa Rica have shown that it is impossible to power entire countries without fossil fuels.
