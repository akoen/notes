#+title: Electric Vehicles

- Fallacy: Electic vehicles are responsible for [[file:climate_change.org][Â§Climate Change]] because their electricity is sourced from fossil fuels. This is wrong because:
  1. Energy production is no greater than 25% efficient, while natural gas is about 60% efficient.
  2. Energy production is moving towards more renewable sources.
