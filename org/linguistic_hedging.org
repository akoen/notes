#+title: Linguistic Hedging

In linguistics, hedges signal uncertainty:

- Instead of "this fact is true", a hedge would imply "/it seems/ that this face /may/ be true".

cite:zhangConversationsGoneAwry2018 found that in conversations on [[id:93c93063-5101-4470-9f84-654bc03bfa14][Â§Social Media]] (or in this case Wikipedia talk pages), conversations that use more hedges and less direct language are more likely to maintain their civility.
