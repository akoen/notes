#+TITLE: Climate Change

- One day at a temperature of 58ºC would kill most of Earth's crops and animals.
- We would collectively be better off if we took the necessary measures to fight climate change, but for each CEO, politician, and lobbyist with the power to make the change, /they/ are better off if they maintain the status quo.
  - This is the same reason we struggle with [[file:consistency.org][§Consistency]]. Whenever we are faced with the choice of whether of whether or not to skip the gym in favour of studying, it is most likely a better immediate choice to do so. However, like with climate change, we need to force ourselves to take immediate action in favour of our collective wellbeing.
