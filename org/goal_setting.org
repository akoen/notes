- In order to achieve a specific, well-defined goal you must have a plan, you must write it down, and *you must look at it every day*.

- The problem with goals is that we work so hard to achieve them, but as soon as we do, it only feels good for a few moments before we ask ourselves once again, "what's next". We must learn to fall in love with the process and not merely the goal, for the goal is fleeting.

- The problem with goal-setting is that when we're working towards a goal, we tend to measure the gap between it and our current ability and when we achieve it, it only feels good for a moment. Instead, consider measuring the gap between where you are and where your started.

- The future is simply the name we give to our imagination. Goals are only effective if they influence the decisions we make in the present. #[[id:8a686a73-4ec4-4f1c-8747-faddecae432d][§Derek Sivers]]
