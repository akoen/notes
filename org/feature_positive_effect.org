#+title: Feature-Positive Effect

- Feature-positive effect :: we naturally prioritize information that is the most readily available to us over that which is the most relevant. [[file:books/How-to-Take-Smart-Notes.org][Â§How to Take Smart Notes]]
  - This is typically whatever information is the most /recent/, as recent ideas feel more concrete and are laden with emotion.
  - The slipbox provides a permanent record of your thinking. Therefore, it helps to circumvent the feature positive effect since all the information is readily available.
