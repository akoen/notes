#+title: Feature-Positive Effect

- Feature-positive effect :: we naturally prioritize information that is the most readily available to us over that which is the most relevant. [[id:a0b85e10-52ee-4f4f-b8b5-960875348749][§How to Take Smart Notes]]
  - This is typically whatever information is the most /recent/, as recent ideas feel more concrete and are laden with emotion.
  - The [[id:02ca221b-f6d8-4ca6-8a3e-3000bffa6892][§slipbox]] provides a permanent record of your thinking. Therefore, it helps to circumvent the feature positive effect since all the information is readily available.
