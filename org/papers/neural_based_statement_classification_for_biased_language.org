#+TITLE: Neural Based Statement Classification for Biased Language



- keywords :: Computer Science - Computation and Language,WRDS150
- author :: Hube, C., & Fetahu, B.

The purpose of this study was to quantify biased phrasing in Wikipedia articles using [[id:03f38845-378d-4a1e-82f1-e7c056f59f90][§Machine Learning]]—rather than feature-based—techniques.

- Their model was able to detect biased statements with a precision of P = 91.7%.
  - This outperforms feature-based models by over 30%.
  - They specifically targeted words that were /inflammatory/ or /partial./

- The use of language is shaped around the needs and characteristics of a given group.

- "in Wikipedia's case , most NPOV violations are w.r.t biased language (i) - (iv), and often onesided statements (v), specifically in the form of epistemological and framing bias. Epistemological refers to linguistic cues that have impact in the believability of a statement, while framing refers to the terms and phrases that are one-sided in the case where a topic may have multiple viewpoints."
