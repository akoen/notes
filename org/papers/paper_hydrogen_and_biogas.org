- Hydrogen has the highest energy density of any known substance (120,000 kJ/kg).
    
- Biogas is a mixture of mainly CH₄ and CO_2 with trace amounts of H₂S, NH_3, H₂, N₂, O₂ and H₂O.

  - Produced by microorganisms that anaerobically decompose organic matter such as animal waste, sewage, landfills etc.

- 90% of [[file:../hydrogen.org][§Hydrogen]] is derived from CH₄ (methane reforming). The most common processes are "steam reforming", "partial oxidation reforming", and "auto thermal reforming".
  - Require temperatures of 600–1000 ℃.

- SR (eq. 1) is low efficiency, but most commonly used.
  - Mandates the separation of CO from H₂, which is costly.
  - Requires external power supply.
    
- POR (eq. 7) is slightly exothermic but requires high temperatures.
  - Lower CO to H_2 ratio.

- ATR is a combination of the two (eq. 9)
  - Reactor can be quickly stopped and restarted.

- The greatest challenge in reforming biogas is the formation of coke on the surface of the catalyst.
  
- The H₂S must be removed from biogas before reforming.
