  - This study attempted to be the first to find a direct causal relationship between deindividualization in participants and an increase in antinormative behaviour. [[file:../deindividualization_theory.org][Â§Deindividualization Theory]]

  - Two groups of students were given the opportunity to cheat on a test described as an evaluation of general intelligence.

  - During the test, half of the students were both seated in front of a large mirror and were played voice recordings of themselves in order to increase self-awareness.

  - The other half of the students (the control group) were seated orthogonal to the mirror and were played voice recordings of a different man.

  - Only 7% of the self-aware students cheated while 69% of the deindividualized students cheated.
