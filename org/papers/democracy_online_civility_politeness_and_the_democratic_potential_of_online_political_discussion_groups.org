"This article explores the potential for civil discourse in cyberspace by examining the level of civility in 287 discussion threads in political newsgroups." (Papacharissi 2004:259)

*"While scholars often use civility and politeness interchangeably, this study argues that this conflation ignores the democratic merit of robust and heated discussion." (Papacharissi 2004:259)*

"because the absence of face-to-face communication fostered more heated discussion, cyberspace might actually promote Lyotard's vision of democratic emancipation through disagreement and anarchy (Lyotard, 1984)." (Papacharissi 2004:259)

"skeptics caution that technologies not universally accessible and ones that frequently induce fragmented, nonsensical, and enraged discussion (otherwise known as 'flaming') far from guarantee a revived public sphere" (Papacharissi 2004:260)

"Schudson argues that conversation is often too civility-driven, and frequently needs to be more robust, rude, and self-absorbed, stating that 'democracy may require withdrawal from civility itself' (1997: 12)." (Papacharissi 2004:260)

"it is not civility that limits the democratic potential of conversation, but rather, a confusion of politeness with civility" (Papacharissi 2004:260)

"this study reconsiders the concept of civility, by identifying civil behaviors which enhance democratic conversation." (Papacharissi 2004:260)

"All messages were read in their entirety, and coded for instances of civility/ incivility, politeness/impoliteness, and a few other message characteristics, by two coders who were trained on a subsample." (Papacharissi 2004:272)

"This study revealed that, contrary to popular belief and consistent with previous research (Hill and Hughes, 1998), most messages posted on political newsgroups are neither predominantly impolite nor uncivil, although frequently disembodied and distracted." (Papacharissi 2004:275)

"All impolite messages were replies to a debate. Almost all (with the exception of two that were calls for action) uncivil messages were also replies to a debate." (Papacharissi 2004:275)

"The assignment of stereotypes to offend or undermine the opponent's arguments was the most common type of incivility. More than two-thirds of all the uncivil messages (27 messages) used stereotypes in an antagonistic manner, and only one message used a 'neutral' stereotype (.86 reliability)." (Papacharissi 2004:275)

"When being impolite, newsgroup discussants preferred using covert forms of impoliteness, such as sarcasm, all-caps (equivalent to shouting in netiquette), and other forms of aggressive replies." (Papacharissi 2004:275)

"Use of vulgarity was the second most popular strategy of impoliteness, with one-quarter (14) of all impolite messages containing some vulgar expressions, such as 'shit', 'damn', or 'hell' (.89 reliability)." (Papacharissi 2004:275)

"The obsession with argumentation skills often led to debates over minute details or even about the principles of argumentation. This in turn escalated to discussion that was very antagonistic, frequently superficial, and sometimes impolite" (Papacharissi 2004:278)

"In conclusion, this study finds that the distinction between civility and politeness is meaningful to this context, because it allows us to distinguish discussion that is harmful for democratic norms from discussion that does not acknowledge the etiquette basics." (Papacharissi 2004:280)
