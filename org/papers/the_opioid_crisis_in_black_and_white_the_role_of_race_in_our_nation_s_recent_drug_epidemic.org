- In 1996 the American Pain Society introduced the concept of 'pain as the fifth vital sign'. Since pain is subjective, this led to over-prescription of opioids to combat perceived pain.

- When drug crises disproportionately affect white Americans, public opinion and government policy treats it as a public health crisis. When black populations are more severely impacted, however, it is treated as a criminal problem.
  - The opioid crisis mostly affects white populations. Consequently, only 9% called for criminal justice approaches.

- While African Americans and white Americans use illicit drugs at similar rates, African Americans are ten times more likely to be incarcerated for drug use.
