- The error rates of NGS reads range from ~0.1–10%. cite:poplin
- The previous best variant calling algorithms were highly specialized to the Illumina platform, and are thus 
- In 2018, engineers at Google demonstrated a convolutional neural network—a prominent class of neural network used in computer vision—named DeepVariant that could identify SNP and indel mutations more than 50% more accurately than the next best algorithm. cite:poplin
