#+title: Purposeful/Deliberate Practice

*Practice performed through repetition leads to stagnation and eventual decline.* Like an athlete, the best learners are those who plan their practice and then execute their plans /deliberately./

Purposeful practice:
1. Has well-defined, specific goals.
2. Is focused.
3. Involves feedback.
4. Gets you out of your comfort zone.

Deliberate practice expands upon purposeful practice and:
1. Develops skills that have /already/ been mastered by experts and for which effective training techniques have already been developed.
2. Incorporates expert instructors to guide a student's practice and provide effective feedback.
   
However, outside of the original literature the term deliberate practice is typically used to refer to all of these principles collectively.
