* Disadvantages

- Footprint ::  To match the energy output of a 1GW and 1mi² [[file:nuclear_fission.org][§Nuclear Fission]] power plant, a solar farm would need to produce 3.3–5.4 GW of power (because of intermittency) and would require 35–75 mi² of land ([[https://www.nei.org/news/2015/land-needs-for-wind-solar-dwarf-nuclear-plants][source]])
