#+title: The importance of privacy

*Privacy is about preventing those in power from gaining more control.* It is the right for you to choose what information you share, with whom you share it, and for your personal information not be used against you. Privacy is inalienable from freedomâ€”without it you lose your autonomy.

* Why we shouldn't be able to sell our personal data

Some argue that we should be able to see our personal data to companies. This is a bad idea for two reasons:
1. You don't know what you're consenting to. If you sell your health data to medical researchers, that data might be used to deny you insurance.
2. Privacy is a collective concern. If you expose your genetic data, you're also exposing the genetic data of your family, who may not have consented. If you expose your location data, you're also exposing the location of your coworkers.
