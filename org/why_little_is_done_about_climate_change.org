#+title: Why Little is Done About Climate Change

In 205, only 0.2% of the US's GDP was invested in renewable energy ([[https://ourworldindata.org/energy#investment-in-renewable-technologies][source]]). Why? 

- The market always does what is cheap and simple.

- We would collectively be better off if we took the necessary measures to fight [[file:climate_change.org][§Climate Change]], but for each CEO, politician, and lobbyist with the power to make the change, /they/ are better off if they maintain the status quo.
  - This is the same reason we struggle with [[file:consistency.org][§Consistency]]. Whenever we are faced with the choice of whether of whether or not to skip the gym in favour of studying, it is most likely a better immediate choice to do so. However, like with climate change, we need to force ourselves to take immediate action in favour of our collective wellbeing.
