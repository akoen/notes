David Perell is my favourite online creator. He is a fantastic writer and an engaging interviewer, but above all, he is unmatched in his joy of learning.

He writes at https://www.perell.com/, hosts the [[https://www.perell.com/podcast][North Star Podcast]]
, and works closely with [[id:daaf7a0e-7b41-4929-a39e-4ea2c6a25fa6][Tiago Forte]].
