- Today, hydrogen is primarily used for oil refining and ammonia production.

- The Saturn V rocket used hydrogen and oxygen for its second and third stage engines.

- There is a clear capacity to retrofit current industrial ports for lower-cost, lower-carbon hydrogen.

- *Hydrogen is a means of energy storage, not an energy-generation method.*
  
- The crucial distinction between [[id:494cbc52-16af-4300-8a43-acc583688416][Hydrogen]] and electricity is that hydrogen is stock-based, while electricity is flow based.
  - Hydrogen can be stored and transported easily, and can match demand.

  - Electricity is challenging to store at scale, and energy production must vary to meet demand in real-time.

- Hydrogen has an energy per unit mass of 120.1 MJ/kg, which is 3x that of gasoline. However, even liquefied hydrogen has an energy per unit volume of 1/3 that of LNG. (pg. 35)

- Current hydrogen gas production is almost entirely supplied from fossil fuels.
  - Responsible for 830 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year (comparable to the UK and Indonesia combined).

- Energy sources :: Hydrogen can be made using:
  - Renewable electricity
  - Biomass
  - Nuclear
  - Fossil fuels, rendered low-emissions through [[id:a1b96972-79f3-4c19-8a1f-fb6905a2e81b][Carbon Capture]]

- To contribute to a more sustainable future, existing applications of hydrogen can make use of clean production methods or hydrogen can be used as an alternative to current high-emission fuels sources.

- The relative costs of producing low-carbon hydrogen are unclear, but *will depend on government support.*

- As with any energy technology, adoption is dependent on infrastructure.

- The *efficiency* of hydrogen is low. The process of converting energy to hydrogen, shipping and then storing the hydrogen, and then converting the hydrogen back into energy in a fuel cell can be less than 30% efficient.

  - This makes it more expensive, but this is not necessarily a deal-breaker if the energy supply is unconstrained.

*Power-generation efficiencies:*
- H_2 fuel cell ~60%
- Gasoline internal combustion engine ~20%
- Coal-fired power plant 45%.

- Electric power line losses ~10%.
