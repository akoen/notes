Ambient [[id:690198da-5662-4141-a601-f93229f90675][privacy]] is a term coined by Maciej Ceglowski which encapsulates the idea that there is value in having the small details of our daily lives be forgotten.

- There should not be a record of our private conversations or what we do when we're home by ourselves.
