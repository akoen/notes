This is the premise of the book [The Slight Edge]({{<relref "The-Slight-Edge.md" >}}) by Jeff Olson.

Life is easy—you're difficult. If you can master the most mundane of tasks and avoid distraction, you will live an extraordinary life.

> The older I get, the clearer it becomes that our internal battle as the kindergarten teachers of our mind is like 97% of life’s struggle. The world is easy—you’re difficult. If you find yourself continually not executing your plans in life and your promises to yourself, you’ve uncovered your new #1 priority—becoming a better kindergarten teacher. Until you do, your life will be run by a bunch of primitive, short-sighted 5-year-olds, and your whole shit will suck. Trust me, I know.
