#+title: Plurality Voting

Plurality voting is a [[id:895de7be-5ff8-477a-96d7-3bdc0376f248][Voting System]] where the candidate (or other choice) with the highest number of votes wins, and voters may only vote for a single candidate.

When voting for a single candidate, this is also known as first-past-the-post.

Here, even though most voters agree with policies in the upper-right quadrant, blue wins because those voters are split.
