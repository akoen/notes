One of my favourite quotes of all time:

> Everyone is shy. Other people are waiting for you to introduce yourself to them, they are waiting for you to send them an email, they are waiting for you to ask them on a date. Go ahead.
> â€” Kevin Kelly

Shyness is the social manifestation of anxiety. It holds us back constantly, and prevents of from finding real connection with others.
