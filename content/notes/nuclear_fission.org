* Advantages
- Fuel is cheap
- The life cycle [[id:7dc67971-7a25-4e52-b5d0-642e5613ee08][GHG Intensity]] of nuclear is estimated to be ~12g COâ‚‚/kWh ([[https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-iii.pdf#page=7][source]])

* Disadvantages

- Average construction time of 6 years.
- Difficult to turn off.
- Nuclear power plants depend on social capital. If public opinion sways such that citizens are uncomfortable with [[id:1e40db06-e1f6-405b-aaf3-d83af8cb1bd6][Nuclear Energy]], the plant will shut down.
