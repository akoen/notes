#+title: Discipline is Invisible

- People who achieve their goals put in the work every single day, even when that work is painful and has no reward. [[id:e927be7d-6f83-4afe-96f8-d5b2e14258a8][The Slight Edge]]

- In contrast, [[id:806a7fda-b943-4160-8af1-e71c19d6f9a7][David Perell]] has this to say about discipline: "Success shouldn't be synonymous with how good you are at forcing yourself to do what you don't want to do."
