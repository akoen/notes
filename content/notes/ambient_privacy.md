Ambient [privacy]({{<relref "digital_privacy.md" >}}) is a term coined by Maciej Ceglowski which encapsulates the idea that there is value in having the small details of our daily lives be forgotten.

-   There should not be a record of our private conversations or what we do when we're home by ourselves.
