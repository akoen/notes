## The Book in 3 Sentences {#the-book-in-3-sentences}

Nims Purja is the strongest mountain climber to ever live. During a six-month period in 2019, he climbed the 14 highest peaks in the world, demolishing the previous record of seven years. This is a superhuman feat, and his book captures what makes him so badass.


## Impressions {#impressions}

This book isn't particularly well-written, nor is it filled with anything other than stories of hardcore climbing. It's a book about Nims, and a damn good one at that. He is absolutely incredible, and this book shows what makes him achieve feats that no one else can.


## How the Book Changed Me {#how-the-book-changed-me}

Nims inspires me. I want to be strong like him and match his mental fortitude. He has no fear, a while I don't want to be reckless, there is much for him to teach me.


## Top 3 Highlights {#top-3-highlights}

> I then swam as many kilometres as my body could handle. I blazed through freestyle length after freestyle length in the pool, before blowing out after 2,500 metres. I rarely made it to bed before midnight, where I’d collapse, exhausted, sometimes getting up again at 2 a.m. to perform a seventy-five-pound load carry from Maidstone barracks to Chatham.\*

> This was an ethos I’d long applied to life: if I ever got up in the morning and told myself that I was going to do three hundred push-ups that day, I made sure to do them, wholeheartedly, because to skip the effort would be to break a commitment, and breaking commitments led to failure.

## Highlights {#highlights}

-   I was out of control and the two rules I’d set previously for myself on expeditions were being tested under extreme pressure. One: Hope was God. Two: The little things counted most on the big mountains.

-   the mountains were delivering their first major lesson: Never burn yourself out unnecessarily.

-   During the Anglo–Nepalese War (1814–16) between Nepal, then known as the Gorkha Kingdom, and the British East India Company (or EIC, a private army, which was double the size of the regular British Army), the skills of the Nepali fighters were so admired that any defectors turning to the EIC for work following a treaty agreement were employed as ‘irregular forces’.

-   \*The Gurkha soldier was legendary and their motto, Better to Die Than to Be a Coward, conjured up images of heroism.

-   **From an early age, I believed in the power of positive thinking; I didn’t allow myself to become poleaxed by illnesses, or chronic ailments that carried the potential to afflict other individuals for years. I felt like a human antibiotic because I’d taught myself to think that way: I trusted myself to heal. I believed.**

-   ‘You think I’m fucking frightened of this?’ I continued, dropping the Vallon detector we used to locate bombs and mines, and walking around the room, unfazed. ‘My life doesn’t mean anything here. But reputation does. That’s why I’m doing this job properly.’

-   **I then swam as many kilometres as my body could handle. I blazed through freestyle length after freestyle length in the pool, before blowing out after 2,500 metres. I rarely made it to bed before midnight, where I’d collapse, exhausted, sometimes getting up again at 2 a.m. to perform a seventy-five-pound load carry from Maidstone barracks to Chatham.**

-   Sometimes I went to church, other times I’d visit a Buddhist monastery, but I always wanted to learn new ideas; I was open and human, I respected every religion in the world, but I had faith in myself more than anything.

-   But I still made the same mistakes as everybody else, as I had done throughout my career so far, but I worked to the theory that the military elite would require me to be resolute and flexible when I got there, and nobody was going to do me any favours, or encourage me to work harder. I had to motivate myself at all times. If I found myself in a bad situation, it was down to me to dig myself out. Often it was hard not to snap under the emotional stress, and everything was a mindfuck.

-   I was even shot during one mission, but I didn’t present fear or vulnerability.

-   A sniper had taken his shot, I reckoned he was probably aiming for my neck, or head, but the aim was a fraction off. The bullet had ricocheted away from the metal extension and smashed through the rifle’s trigger housing mechanism, exiting at an angle that had taken it across my face.

-   **This was an ethos I’d long applied to life: if I ever got up in the morning and told myself that I was going to do three hundred push-ups that day, I made sure to do them, wholeheartedly, because to skip the effort would be to break a commitment, and breaking commitments led to failure.**

-   Assessing risk and reacting accordingly had become second nature; I understood the fine line between being brave and being stupid; negative situations didn’t upend me, and I attacked everything with positive thought.

-   **Also, I was comfortable with the idea of going out in my thirties. Hanging on until the age of eighty-something, a time when I’d become unable to look after myself, held very little appeal. I wanted to leave while going out at full tilt.**

-   was then asked to consider the logistical pitfalls of my move, and it was argued that by resigning I’d be losing out on the type of financial security that would have excited most people in the Real World. Except, I wasn’t most people; I had a different take on the Real World. I’d been raised a poor kid in Nepal. If I really had to, living out of a tent for the rest of my life would have posed no problems at all.

-   I approached every day with a positive thought: I can do this. I will navigate just about every problem the mission might throw at me. I’ve already climbed the world’s tallest peak. The only thing standing in my way right now is funding. Get out there and smash it.

-   It felt good to be outside, climbing at altitude across an environment that didn’t care about race, religion, colour or gender.

-   **Whenever friends had opened up to me about the serious emotional problems they might have been having, I’d taken them climbing.**

-   **Life felt so much simpler when you were connected to nature by a climbing rope and a set of crampons.**

-   **Alongside him on the support team, Lakpa Dendi Sherpa was a climber who had previously helped me to fix the lines on the G200E in 2017. Together, we’d hauled twenty-four kilometres of rope to the top of Everest on summit day.**

-   The rules were certainly very different during high- altitude expeditions, but my attitude had been hardwired, plus it was the reason I used oxygen in the first place. ‘Let’s get this dude down as well,’ I said.

-   In life I was always encouraged to admit to a mistake. If ever I fucked up on a military operation, I would mention it to my teammates. By shining a light on my failings, I was able to improve upon them and I would never use the excuse that a mountain was impossible to climb because of traffic. I’d plan and find another route to the top.

-   **The biggest problem facing humanity at this moment in history is our inability to think long-term.**

-   it was packed with alpha males and females, exactly the type of people that turned up in the Special Forces. I’d learned during service that the best way to work with personalities of that kind was to pretend to be bigger and better than all of them.

-   **With a small Bluetooth speaker, the Project Possible team was able to transform any dining tent into a club after dark, banging out Nepalese pop hits and loud rock music into the early hours of the morning, as we passed around bottles of beer and whisky.**

-   **We left our camp at 4 a.m. and arrived at the bottom of GI around 5 p.m., covering fifty-four kilometres in thirteen hours, while carrying a lot more than thirty-five kilos per person.**

-   **I heard a cry. Mingma! He’d taken a misstep and been sucked into an unseen crevasse. I crawled across to find him, fearing the worst, careful not to plunge into another hidden maw; but when I peered into the body-sized hole, Mingma was peering back at me. By some sheer fluke, his bag had snagged on the edge, fixing his body in place.**

-   ‘Guys, we are the best climbers from Nepal,’ I said. ‘It is time to show the world what we are capable of. Let’s get this done.’ We pulled on our heavy packs and oxygen masks. Then we started our climb to the top, moving with the energy of one hundred men.

-   Each step had felt torturous as I heaved their weight towards Camp 4, and every now and then I briefly imagined the sweet release of an avalanche collapsing above me.

-   Suffering sometimes created a weird sense of satisfaction for me. The psychological power of always giving 100 per cent, where simply knowing I was delivering my all,

-   after a few days or a few weeks, surviving even higher up the mountain becomes a habit for a lot of people, especially if they have positivity.

-   **There was a nod and a smile. But she didn’t have to say anything – I knew Mum was on my side. She always had been.**

-   I want to be at the world’s highest point again, knowing it might slip out from underneath me at any moment. Because that is the only way to live – and to die.

-   Be confident, but show respect.

-   **Brother, you’re not going to get to your dream by just fantasising about it.**

-   As a kid, I got so pissed off at being beaten by a runner from another school in the district champs that I started getting up in the middle of the night in secret training sessions.

-   Give 100 per cent to the now because it’s all you’ve got.

-   If I say that I’m going to run for an hour, I’ll run for a full hour. If I plan to do three hundred push-ups in a training session, I won’t quit until I’ve done them all. Because brushing off the effort means letting myself down and I don’t want to have to live with that. And neither should you.
