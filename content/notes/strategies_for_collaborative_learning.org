#+title: Strategies for Collaborative Learning

- Collaboration is an integral component of [[id:698a8d51-5a32-4e47-91b1-ee8984c860ab][Learning]].
- In Japan, they employ a specific approach to math education called /structured problem solving/. Students are posed a challenging math problem at the start of the lesson and are then asked to work on it individually for a short period of time. Then, crucially, there is a /whole class/ discussion of the various solutions, facilitated by the teacher whose job is to mediate the conversation and lead students to the best solution.
