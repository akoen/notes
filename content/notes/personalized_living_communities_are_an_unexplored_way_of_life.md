In his newsletter, [§David Perell]({{< relref "david_perell" >}}) proposed the idea of personalized living communities—groups of friends who rent or buy houses close together and then communally cook, host activities, and raise their kids as a group.

This would perhaps emulate the [§University/College]({{< relref "university" >}}) lifestyle that people so often miss when they leave school. It must be hard to make and maintain friendships as an adult, and so this way of living might provide a greater sense of community for those who participate.

Original quote:

> Long-term, I've been thinking about what it'd look like to live with a group of 10-30 friends and raise our kids together. We'd get a group of houses on the same street in an affordable area, eat meals together, and co-hire tutors to homeschool our kids.
