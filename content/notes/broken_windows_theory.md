-   Broken Windows Theory is a criminology theory which observes that a single minor sign of unresolved criminal activity, like broken windows, leads to rampant crime.

-   This is extended to explain why minor unresolved bugs in software projects can lead to the entire project's demise or why a few dirty dishes left in the sink can lead to the house's decline into disarray.

-   The solution is to clean up the visible signs of disorder.
