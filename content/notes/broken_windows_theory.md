-   Broken Windows Theory is a criminology theory which observes that signs of minor criminal activity that have not been taken care of  (like broken windows, for example), leads to a spike in crime.

-   "Broken windows" present the appearance of apathy.

-   This is extended to explain why minor unresolved bugs in [Programming]({{<relref "programming.md" >}}) projects can lead to the entire project's demise or why a few dirty dishes left in the sink can lead to the house's decline into disarray.

-   The solution is to clean up the visible signs of disorder.
