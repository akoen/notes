-   Fallacy: Electic vehicles are responsible for [Climate Change]({{<relref "climate_change.md" >}}) because their electricity is sourced from fossil fuels. This is wrong because:
    1.  Energy production is no greater than 25% efficient, while natural gas is about 60% efficient.
    2.  Energy production is moving towards more renewable sources.
