- Fallacy: Electic vehicles are responsible for [[id:5736cee7-7a57-42b1-a81c-341ea54c011d][Climate Change]] because their electricity is sourced from fossil fuels. This is wrong because:
  1. Energy production is no greater than 25% efficient, while natural gas is about 60% efficient.
  2. Energy production is moving towards more renewable sources.
