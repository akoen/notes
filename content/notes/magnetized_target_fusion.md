Magnetized Target Fusion is a way of performing [§Nuclear Fusion]({{< relref "nuclear_fusion" >}}) that combines the concepts of [§Magnetic Confinement Fusion]({{< relref "magnetic_confinement_fusion" >}}) and [§Inertial Confinement Fusion]({{< relref "inertial_confinement_fusion" >}}).

-   A spherical shell of molten lead-lithium is used to compress hydrogen [§Plasma]({{< relref "plasma" >}}) to the temperature required for fusion.

-   The heat captured by this metal is then used to run a steam turbine.
