Magnetized Target Fusion is a way of performing [Nuclear Fusion]({{<relref "nuclear_fusion.md" >}}) that combines the concepts of [Magnetic Confinement Fusion]({{<relref "magnetic_confinement_fusion.md" >}}) and [Inertial Confinement Fusion]({{<relref "inertial_confinement_fusion.md" >}}).

-   A spherical shell of molten lead-lithium is used to compress hydrogen [Plasma]({{<relref "plasma.md" >}}) to the temperature required for fusion.

-   The heat captured by this metal is then used to run a steam turbine.
