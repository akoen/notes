## Notes {#notes}

"platforms may be "leveraging their access to information about users and their control over the user experience to mislead, coerce, or otherwise disadvantage sharing economy participants"." (Christl 2017:96)

"irms could increasingly "use what they know about consumers" to not only "match them to content they might prefer" but also to "nudge consumers to pay more, to work for less, and to behave in other ways that advantage a firm"." (Christl 2017:96)

"corporate actors can systematically abuse their resultant unprecedented data wealth for their economic advantage." (Christl 2017:96)

"Algorithmic decisions based on digital profiles may reinforce existing biases and social inequalities and even become self-fulfilling prophecies." (Christl 2017:97)

"When people know that they are being constantly monitored, this can produce chilling effects on forms of action or expression." (Christl 2017:97)

"Consumers can "hardly avoid privacy contracts" because "almost all banks, software and hardware vendors, social networking sites, digital content services, retail loyalty programs, and telecommunications providers employ them"" (Christl 2017:97)

""opting out of surveillance capitalism is like opting out of electricity, or cooked foods â€” you are free to do it in theory"; in practice, it means "opting out of much of modern life"." (Christl 2017:97)

"In crucial areas of life such as finance, insurance, housing, healthcare, welfare, law enforcement, and employment, many would agree that inaccurate, biased or discriminatory automated decisions based on digital profiles about consumers can harm individuals and vulnerable population groups." (Christl 2017:97)

"today's online marketing technologies go far beyond simply displaying ads. Based on data-driven predictive analytics, personalization, measurement, and testing, they aim to influence behavior at scale" (Christl 2017:98)

"For this purpose, businesses aggregate and link personal identifiers such as email addresses, phone numbers, smartphone IDs, and platform user account IDs and use them to recognize people, as well as to link and combine profiles about them across different services, platforms, devices, and life contexts." (Christl 2017:101)
