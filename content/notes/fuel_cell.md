Unlike a heat engine, fuel cells are not limited by the Carnot efficiency. <sup id="2591c98b70119fe624898b1e424b5e91"><a href="#shell" title="Adolf, Balzer, Louis, Schabla, Fischedick, Arnold, Pastowski \&amp; Sch\uwer, Shell hydrogen study energy of the future?

High-temperature fuel cells such as the solid-oxide fuel cell can make use a combined heat and power process (CHP), leading to higher efficiencies.

## Types of fuel cells {#types-of-fuel-cells}

-   In general as the operating temperature of the fuel cell increases, the purity of hydrogen required decreases <sup id="2591c98b70119fe624898b1e424b5e91"><a href="#shell" title="Adolf, Balzer, Louis, Schabla, Fischedick, Arnold, Pastowski \&amp; Sch\uwer, Shell hydrogen study energy of the future?

-   Are the most applicable to the transportation sector,
    -   Expensive due to a platinum catalyst.
    -   Operates with air rather than pure oxygen.
    -   Highest potential for cost reduction. Expected to achieve 30 $/kWel (kilowatt electric), which is comparable to ICEs.


### Solid oxide fuel cell <sup id="2591c98b70119fe624898b1e424b5e91"><a href="#shell" title="Adolf, Balzer, Louis, Schabla, Fischedick, Arnold, Pastowski \&amp; Sch\uwer, Shell hydrogen study energy of the future?

-   The second most important type of fuel cell.
-   More efficient than the PEMFC, but hindered due to high start-up times.
-   Applicable to power plants and home energy.
