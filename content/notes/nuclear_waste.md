The image below shows the possible products, coloured by the likelihood that they will be produced.

## Implications {#implications}

If the USA was powered entirely by nuclear energy, each person would be responsible for ~40g of nuclear waste per year.

-   Compared to ~10,000 kg per year per person of CO₂ #[§Greenhouse Gas Emissions]({{< relref "greenhouse_gas_emissions" >}})
