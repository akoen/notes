-   First drafts should be messy, experimental, and rushed. Spend your time rewriting, not getting it right the first time.

    > “Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can’t write and edit, or sculpt and polish, or make and analyze at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don’t select. While you sketch, don’t inspect. While you write the first draft, don’t reflect. At the start, the creator mind must be unleashed from judgment.”

-   It is a common flaw in essay writing (notably [§Academic Writing]({{< relref "academic_writing" >}})) to make a statement accurate by making it vague. You may say that the issue is complex or that there are many factors involved. In general, avoid this.
