The Two-Day Rule states that you are not allowed to skip a habit more than one-day in a row.


Habits are formed through [Consistency]({{<relref "consistency.md" >}}), but that doesn't mean that no improvement will occur if you don't perform them every day.


This is an effective way of maintaining motivation, since people often give up if they miss a single day.
