The secret to performing under pressure is not to try too hard. When you reach a state of **relaxed concentration**, you perform at your best. #[§The Inner Game of Tennis]({{< relref "the_inner_game_of_tennis" >}})

Those who play best play with _abandon_ They completely relinquish any expectation of performance and trust their body to do what it must.

> “Abandon” is a good word to describe what happens to a tennis player who feels he has nothing to lose. He stops caring about the outcome and plays all out. It is a letting go of the concerns of Self 1 and letting in of the natural concerns of a deeper and truer self. It is caring, yet not caring; it is effort, but effortless at the same time.
