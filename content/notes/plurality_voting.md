Plurality voting is a [Voting System]({{<relref "voting_systems.md" >}}) where the candidate (or other choice) with the highest number of votes wins, and voters may only vote for a single candidate.

When voting for a single candidate, this is also known as first-past-the-post.

Here, even though most voters agree with policies in the upper-right quadrant, blue wins because those voters are split.
