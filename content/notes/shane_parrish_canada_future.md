Build a trans-Canada fibre pipeline.


Roll out 5g nationwide.


Ensure reliable internet access for rural and remote areas.


Build a domestic capability to create and manufacture microchips.


Ensure digital literacy and skills for the future, including implementing mandatory coding classes from early primary to Grade 12. Teach [online privacy]({{<relref "digital_privacy.md" >}}) in all of these grades as well. (see [What classes should be taught in school?]({{<relref "what_classes_should_be_taught_in_school.md" >}}))


Build a high-speed rail network, starting with Montreal-Ottawa-Toronto corridor.


Repatriate critical know-how and manufacturing capabilities in key industries such as heath, aerospace, and silicon.


Launch a targeted repatriation/[immigration]({{<relref "immigration.md" >}}) program that would actively recruit and fund Canadians and non-Canadians living abroad with specific expertise to set up Canadian capabilities. (Pretend we run a sports team and recuit the best people to come build.)


Implement a government matching loan program to provide interest-free matching loans from $2M to $10M to proven entrepreneurs in addition to an equity stake. E.g. Proven entrepreneur invests $10M of own capital, Gov matches with interest-free loan for 10 years and 5% equity.


Rapidly scale up investments in [Clean Energy]({{<relref "clean_energy.md" >}}) infrastructure.


Let's get started. It's time to build the future.
