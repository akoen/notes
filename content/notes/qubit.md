-   The quantum state of a qubit is a vector of unit length in a 2-dimensional complex vector space known as state space. It is typically represented as &alpha;|0&rang; + &beta;|1&rang;.
    -   |0&rang; and |1&rang; represent the two standard basis vectors of R^2.

    -   |&alpha;|^2 + |&beta;|^2 = 1

    -   &alpha; and &beta; can be complex numbers.

-   It is **impossible** to directly observe the state of a qubit.

-   When a qubit is measured, the qubit collapses to either |0&rang; or |1&rang; with probabilities |&alpha;|^2 and |&beta;|^2 respectively.
    -   This is a fundamental consequence of physics. If this were not the case, infinite information could be encoded in a single qubit.
