#+title: Algorithmic Bias

In her book [[id:ed64b25e-0281-4062-b7d4-598a0da1bc5b][Hello World]], [[id:0ad3030e-a0d0-43a7-94ad-a3f28f790dca][Hannah Fry]] argues that when algorithms are trained on historical datasets, they learn to perpetuate the biases found within.

In [[id:9967230e-a5fe-40de-83ed-18614c05c669][Privacy is Power]], philosopher Carissa Véliz argues that technology does not compensate for our shortcomings, it merely amplifies them.
