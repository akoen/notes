[David R. MacIver](https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/) proposes a framework for quickly learning challenging concepts:

1.  Find an easy version of whatever you find hard.
2.  Modify the easy version so that it is as hard as the challenging thing in _exactly_ one way.
3.  Practice the modified version until it is easy.
4.  Repeat this process until the hard thing becomes easy.

While this framework is simple, it identifies a key point: the importance of tight [Feedback Loops]({{<relref "feedback_loops.md" >}}) and [Purposeful/Deliberate Practice.]({{<relref "deliberate_practice.md" >}})

-   When you learn, don't focus on getting it right. Instead, focus on _how_ you're performing. Then, target the _specific areas_ where you're performing poorly.
