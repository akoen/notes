In her book [Hello World]({{<relref "hello_world.md" >}}), [Hannah Fry]({{<relref "hannah_fry.md" >}}) argues that when algorithms are trained on historical datasets, they learn to perpetuate the biases found within.

In [Privacy is Power]({{<relref "privacy_is_power.md" >}}), philosopher Carissa Véliz argues that technology does not compensate for our shortcomings, it merely amplifies them.

> But however accurate the results might be, you could argue that using algorithms as a mirror to reflect the real world isn’t always helpful, especially when the mirror is reflecting a present reality that only exists because of centuries of bias.
