Daniel Friedmann argues that the hydrogen economy didn't happen because there's just too much that needs to happen.


Sources of renewable energy such as solar and wind fluctuate and must be stored.
    -   Batteries leak too much current to be feasible in storing terawatt hours of electricity.


The primary cost of fuel cells comes from the high platinum requirement. A catalyst that did not involve large amounts of noble metals would be a huge step forward.


Hydrogen can be sourced from hydrocarbons. The lower the carbon content of the hydrocarbon, the less the emissions.
    -   An alternative to hydrogen as an energy storage mechanism is [Ammonia]({{<relref "ammonia.md" >}})


While it is possible to use hydrogen as a fuel in internal combustion engines, it is rarely done <sup id="2591c98b70119fe624898b1e424b5e91"><a href="#shell" title="Adolf, Balzer, Louis, Schabla, Fischedick, Arnold, Pastowski \&amp; Sch\uwer, Shell hydrogen study energy of the future?
