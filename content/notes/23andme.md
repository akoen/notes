-   23andMe is slowly transitioning from superficial level genetic analysis targeted at consumers to drug discovery.
-   They use [Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS)]({{<relref "genomewide_association_study_gwas.md" >}})


## SNP Chip {#snp-chip}

-   They use "SNP Chips" to test for SNPs.
    -   Specifically, the Illumina Infinum Global Screening Array. <sup id="7412df2b1db8cd2a5d4aafdb6c2090d3"><a href="#research" title="@misc{research,

-   These are credit card-sized chips containing DNA probes which are complementary to known DNA sequences.
-   SNPs are left exposed and can then be identified using fluorescent tags.
-   **Limitation**: SNP Chips are targeted towards common mutations, not rare mutations which are often responsible for disease.

<span class="underline">- **Limitation**: Limited to known mutations only.</span>

-   `Why?`


## Drug discovery {#drug-discovery}

-   In 2014, they demonstrated a twofold increase in the chance that a drug would be approved by the FDA if 23andMe found a correlation between the targeted gene and disease. <sup id="93f49ad13723da97ae173ae135a2cec8"><a href="#have-it-all" title="Servick, Can 23andMe have it all?, {Science}, v(6255), 1472--1477 (2015).">have-it-all</a></sup>
-   23andMe's first drug candidates will most likely be antibodies.
    -   Antibodies are less complicated to produce than small molecule drugs (<500 daltons).
-   <span class="underline">Will require partial or full genome sequencing</span>. <sup id="93f49ad13723da97ae173ae135a2cec8"><a href="#have-it-all" title="Servick, Can 23andMe have it all?, {Science}, v(6255), 1472--1477 (2015).">have-it-all</a></sup>
-   "[23andMe] intends to use SNPs to identify interesting regions of the genome, and then use sequencing to zoom in on those regions in certain patients." <sup id="93f49ad13723da97ae173ae135a2cec8"><a href="#have-it-all" title="Servick, Can 23andMe have it all?, {Science}, v(6255), 1472--1477 (2015).">have-it-all</a></sup>


## FDA {#fda}

-   In 2013, the FDA found many of 23andMe's medical tests to be illegal as they had not been vetted. <sup id="93f49ad13723da97ae173ae135a2cec8"><a href="#have-it-all" title="Servick, Can 23andMe have it all?, {Science}, v(6255), 1472--1477 (2015).">have-it-all</a></sup>


## Surveys {#surveys}

-   They collect ~2 million survey responses per week. <sup id="93f49ad13723da97ae173ae135a2cec8"><a href="#have-it-all" title="Servick, Can 23andMe have it all?, {Science}, v(6255), 1472--1477 (2015).">have-it-all</a></sup>
    -   This is unusually responsive for voluntary survey responses.
    -   All survey responses are stripped of identifying information to protect privacy.
