James Turrell is one of my [[id:1a82a60d-b57c-45de-aaa4-e8a182097672][Favourite Visual Artists]] famous for his exploration of the materiality of light.

Since 1979, he has worked almost exclusively on his /Roden Crater/
project, a volcanic cinder cone that he is retrofitting into a naked-eye observatory and an art installation.
