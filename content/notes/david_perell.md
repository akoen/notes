David Perell is my favourite online creator. He is a fantastic writer and an engaging interviewer, but above all, he is unmatched in his joy of learning.

He writes at <https://www.perell.com/>, hosts the [North Star Podcast](https://www.perell.com/podcast)
, and works closely with [Â§Tiago Forte]({{< relref "tiago_forte" >}}).
