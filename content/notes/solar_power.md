## Advantages {#advantages}

Footprint
: To match the energy output of a 1GW and 1mi² [§Nuclear Fission]({{< relref "nuclear_fission" >}}) power plant, a solar farm would need to produce 3.3–5.4 GW of power (because of intermittency) and would require 35–75 mi² of land ([source](https://www.nei.org/news/2015/land-needs-for-wind-solar-dwarf-nuclear-plants))
