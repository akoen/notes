Nowadays, governments and corporations have unprecedented ability to target—to target individuals not only based on their age and race, but also based on their browsing history, their location, and even their sexual orientation. This is a tremendous business opportunity, for advertising now accounts for 19% of the U.S. GDP, but it comes at an equally devastating cost, because the power to target is also the power to discriminate.

**Privacy is about preventing those in power from gaining more control.** It is the right for you to choose what information you share, with whom you share it, and for your personal information not be used against you. Privacy is inalienable from freedom—without it you lose your autonomy.

-   Companies should be required by law to collect only the data that is strictly required to provide you with their services.
    -   Any other data is _never_ used to benefit you.


## Lack of regulation allows warrantless investigation of citizens {#lack-of-regulation-allows-warrantless-investigation-of-citizens}

-   In 2020 it was revealed that the Department of Homeland Security had purchased a commercial database of location data which tracks the movement of millions of American cellphones ([source](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-agencies-use-cellphone-location-data-for-immigration-enforcement-11581078600)). This data was used to arrest immigrants suspected of crossing the border illegally.

-   Moreover, in 2021 it was revealed that a similar dataset was purchased by the Iowa Air National Guard, a military unit that carries out international drone strikes ([source](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3g97x/location-data-apps-drone-strikes-iowa-national-guard)). This dataset includes the precise location of millions of smartphone users collected without their knowledge from thousands of different apps, notably including several high-profile Muslim prayer apps ([source](https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x)).

-   The governments of many countries collect extremely sensitive data from citizens including those not suspected of any crime. For example, the British OPTICNERVE program, leaked by [§Edward Snowden]({{< relref "edward_snowden" >}}) in 2013, covertly took pictures of Yahoo messenger users every 5 minutes through their webcams without their knowledge. In a six-month period, images of 1.8 million distinct users were collected.


## Privacy should be inalienable {#privacy-should-be-inalienable}

Some argue that we should be able to see our personal data to companies. While this is better than our current system, it is a bad idea for two reasons:

1.  You don't know what you're consenting to. If you sell your health data to medical researchers, that data might be used to deny you insurance.
2.  Privacy is a collective concern. If you expose your genetic data, you're also exposing the genetic data of your family, who may not have consented. If you expose your location data, you're also exposing the location of your coworkers, because that data is also used to identify those you work with.

Data collection shouldn't be a "necessary evil" required for access to education, healthcare, and safety.


## The words used to describe privacy are misleading {#the-words-used-to-describe-privacy-are-misleading}

> Privately owned advertising and surveillance networks are called ‘communities’, citizens are ‘users’, addiction to screens is labelled ‘engagement’, our most sensitive information is considered ‘data exhaust’ or ‘digital breadcrumbs’, spyware is called ‘cookies’, documents that describe our lack of privacy are titled ‘privacy policies’, and what used to be considered wiretapping is now the bedrock of the internet economy.
