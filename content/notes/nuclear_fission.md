## Advantages {#advantages}

-   Fuel is cheap
-   The life cycle [GHG Intensity]({{<relref "emission_intensity.md" >}}) of nuclear is estimated to be ~12g COâ‚‚/kWh ([source](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc%5Fwg3%5Far5%5Fannex-iii.pdf#page=7))


## Disadvantages {#disadvantages}

-   Average construction time of 6 years.
-   Difficult to turn off.
-   Nuclear power plants depend on social capital. If public opinion sways such that citizens are uncomfortable with [Nuclear Energy]({{<relref "nuclear_energy.md" >}}), the plant will shut down.
