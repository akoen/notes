## Advantages {#advantages}

-   Fuel is cheap
-   The life cycle [§GHG Intensity]({{< relref "emission_intensity" >}}) of nuclear is estimated to be ~12g CO₂/kWh ([source](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc%5Fwg3%5Far5%5Fannex-iii.pdf#page=7))


## Disadvantages {#disadvantages}

-   Average construction time of 6 years.
-   Difficult to turn off.
-   Nuclear power plants depend on social capital. If public opinion sways such that citizens are uncomfortable with [§Nuclear Energy]({{< relref "nuclear_energy" >}}), the plant will shut down.
