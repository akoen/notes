[Org-Roam](https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-roam) is an [§Emacs]({{< relref "emacs" >}}) package which tries to emulate the behaviour of [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) in emacs.


## Advantages of org-roam {#advantages-of-org-roam}

1.  Notes are stored in a flat hierarchy. This minimizes the cognitive demand of trying to organize complex information (this is delegated to creating links).
2.  Org-roam implements [§Zettelkasten]({{< relref "zettelkasten" >}}).
3.  Like [§Zettelkasten]({{< relref "zettelkasten" >}}), org-roam _forces_ you to think about how the information contained within a note relates to other notes, resulting in enhanced learning. This is [§Elaboration]({{< relref "elaboration" >}}).
