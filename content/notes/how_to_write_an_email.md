-   Many times people use email to shift responsability onto others. They say, "what do you think about this?" or even simply, "thoughts?"
    -   If you want to be respected, make emails **atomic**, **specific**, and **easy to read**.


## Techniques for writing better emails {#techniques-for-writing-better-emails}

-   Use precise dates. Instead of saying _tomorrow_, say _tomorrow (January 6th)_.

Hi Tim,

**I hope all is well (and I gather from your celebrity that it is—I can’t seem to go a week without seeing your book or name somewhere).**

**I know you place tremendous value on your time so I’ll be brief.** The website I launched last fall (www.SmartRaise.com) has evolved into a much more far-reaching venture: a software company that provides fundraising optimization and online advocacy solutions for nonprofits. I’m raising $500-750k for the business, called Donor Loyalty Corp, and have a meaningful percentage of that already committed from various Angel investors.

**Naturally, I’m** courting a number of prospective Angels from my personal network to hopefully fill out the rest of the round. However, **I was curious if your experience has taught you any lessons about** identifying seed-stage investors and, more **specifically**, if you’ve come to know any Princeton Alums or other individuals who have an appetite for deals like these. I’ve attached my fundraising deck for some context.

**I understand if you’re too busy to answer in depth or would prefer not to discuss the topic given our limited interactions in the past. However, if the professor in you has any pearls of wisdom or specific thoughts, they would be greatly appreciated.**

Thanks in advance and I hope we can connect.

Best,

Robert J. Moore ‘06
