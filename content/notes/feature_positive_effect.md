Feature-positive effect
: we naturally prioritize information that is the most readily available to us over that which is the most relevant. [§How to Take Smart Notes]({{< relref "How-to-Take-Smart-Notes" >}})
    -   This is typically whatever information is the most _recent_, as recent ideas feel more concrete and are laden with emotion.
    -   The [§slipbox]({{< relref "zettelkasten" >}}) provides a permanent record of your thinking. Therefore, it helps to circumvent the feature positive effect since all the information is readily available.
