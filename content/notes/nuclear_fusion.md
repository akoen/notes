-   Fusion occurs when the nuclei of two atoms are forced close enough together that the attraction of the strong force overcomes the electromagnetic repulsion.
    -   The kinetic-energy barrier required to achieve fusion is known as the Coulomb barrier
    -   Requires a temperature of ~100 million K


## Evaluation {#evaluation}

Reactions are evaluated using the Lawson Criterion:

Net power = Efficiency × (Fusion − Radiation loss − Conduction loss)

1.  Net power is the excess power beyond that needed internally for the process to proceed in any fusion power plant.
2.  Efficiency is how much energy is needed to drive the device and how well it collects energy from the reactions.
3.  Fusion is rate of energy generated by the fusion reactions.
4.  Radiation loss is the energy lost as light (including X-rays) leaving the plasma.
5.  Conduction loss is the energy lost as particles leave the plasma, carrying away energy.
