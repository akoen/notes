-   Collaboration is an integral component of [Learning]({{<relref "learning.md" >}}).
-   In Japan, they employ a specific approach to math education called _structured problem solving_. Students are posed a challenging math problem at the start of the lesson and are then asked to work on it individually for a short period of time. Then, crucially, there is a _whole class_ discussion of the various solutions, facilitated by the teacher whose job is to mediate the conversation and lead students to the best solution.
