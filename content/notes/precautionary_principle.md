Broadly, the precautionary principle is the paradigm that a course of action should not be taken when it's potential repercussions are not yet fully understood.

While this is wise in general, it is also an easy way to dismiss innovations with true potential:

-   The risks of not taking action are often not considered. For example, it is estimated to that shutting down all [§Nuclear Power Plants]({{< relref "nuclear_energy" >}}) in Japan following the [§Fukushima Nuclear Disaster]({{< relref "fukushima_nuclear_disaster" >}}), more people died because they could no longer afford to heat their homes in Winter than did from the disaster itself.

-   People will dismiss innovation because of it's harm while ignoring it's potential for good. ([§Digital Privacy]({{< relref "digital_privacy" >}}))
