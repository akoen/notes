#+title: Performing Under Pressure

The secret to performing under pressure is not to try too hard. When you reach a state of *relaxed concentration*, you perform at your best. #[[id:41d61f01-5482-48d2-9b51-76471e432ef1][The Inner Game of Tennis]]

Those who play best play with /abandon/ They completely relinquish any expectation of performance and trust their body to do what it must.

“Abandon” is a good word to describe what happens to a tennis player who feels he has nothing to lose. He stops caring about the outcome and plays all out. It is a letting go of the concerns of Self 1 and letting in of the natural concerns of a deeper and truer self. It is caring, yet not caring; it is effort, but effortless at the same time.
