-   Put simply, your privacy is important because it limits the power of governments and corporations to make judgments about your character. (see [The importance of privacy]({{<relref "the_importance_of_privacy.md" >}}))
    -   These judgments, which may be inaccurate or biased, can then be used to make decisions about youâ€”to selectively grant or deny you opportunities.
