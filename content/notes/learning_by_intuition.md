People often try to learn a skill by identifying flaws in their performance and then trying to intentionally correct for them.

[Learning]({{<relref "learning.md" >}}) by intuition means being [Mindful]({{<relref "mindfulness.md" >}}) of the sensations experienced throughout task and allowing the body to naturally correct for inefficiencies. Timothy Galley's book [The Inner Game of Tennis]({{<relref "the_inner_game_of_tennis.md" >}}) refers to this as _nonjudgmental awareness_.

When practising, focus on results rather than actions. For example, when climbing, instead of focusing on putting your feet in the right place, focus on the sensation of climbing smoothly.
