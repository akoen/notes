It is unhealthy to always know what time it is: clocks lead to an ambient [Anxiety]({{<relref "anxiety.md" >}}) that prevents you from getting into the [Flow State]({{<relref "flow_state.md" >}}).

[David Perell]({{<relref "david_perell.md" >}}), in his weekly newsletter, proposed building a clock that would only display blocks of time. It his case, these blocks were:

9am
: Time to start creative work.

12pm
: Time to start non-creative work.

10pm
: Time to sleep.
