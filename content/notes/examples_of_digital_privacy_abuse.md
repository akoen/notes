## Research {#research}

Kosinski _et al._ were able to predict psychological and demographic traits of individuals with surprising accuracy using a median of 68 Facebook likes. For example, they were able to infer sexual orientation of men, political affiliation, and drug use with 88%, 85%, and 65% accuracy respectively. <sup id="05cad4ec785f5031174da548503106b9"><a href="#kosinskiPrivateTraitsAttributes2013" title="">kosinskiPrivateTraitsAttributes2013</a></sup>


## Corporations {#corporations}

-   Privacy policies are written to be incomprehensible to the average person.

-   In 2007, Google's then CEO Eric Shmidt [said](https://web.archive.org/web/20210524225135/https://www.ft.com/content/c3e49548-088e-11dc-b11e-000b5df10621) "the goal is to enable Google users to be able to ask the questions such as 'What shall I do tomorrow?' and 'What job shall I take?'".
    -   For democracy to function, we need citizens to be autonomous, to think for themselves.

-   The [Mindstrong](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mindstrong&hl=en%5FCA&gl=US) Android app infers whether or not you suffer from depression and other mental disorders based on the way you scroll, type, and tap your phone screen. <https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/10/15/66443/the-smartphone-app-that-can-tell-youre-depressed-before-you-know-it-yourself/>
    -   In 2019, Facebook was [charged](https://web.archive.org/web/20201219124029/https://www.hud.gov/press/press%5Freleases%5Fmedia%5Fadvisories/HUD%5FNo%5F19%5F035) by the U.S. government for discriminating the display of housing-related ads based on race and other protected classes.


### Financial {#financial}

-   Experian, the world's largest credit reporting company, stores credit data on [918 million](https://www.experianplc.com/media/2744/discover-experian-fy17.pdf) people.

-   Experian scores citizens and sells that data to companies. For example, the description for their Connect<sup>SM</sup> service for healthcare providers says "Before you begin a medical procedure and extend them financing, be more informed about your patient's financial situation. It may help in mitigating the risk of late payments and possible need for collections later on."
    -   An experian [marketing document](https://web.archive.org/web/20200927025457/https://www.experian.com/content/dam/marketing/na/assets/ems/marketing-services/documents/product-sheets/audience-lookbook.pdf) describes some of the populations that may be targeted. Including:
        -   **Insecure Debt Dependent:** This segment often considers home equity, but generally treat it as a last resort. **They’re concerned about the possibility of losing a home with a home equity account and tend to live beyond their means.** They’re the least financially secure of the segments.

The director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Richard Cordray, said that "the data managed by the consumer reporting companies – and the scores generated from that data – exert a tremendous influence over the ways and means of people’s financial lives." <https://web.archive.org/web/20210525221056/https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/prepared-remarks-cfpb-director-richard-cordray-consumer-advisory-board-meeting-march-2017/>

-   Cignify, an American credit analytics firm, recently partnered with Equifax to help firms offer loans to Latin American citizens. To do so, they purchase customer data from cell service providers, including "call duration, time calls are made, who initiates a call or test, numbers frequently called" to "help predict people's willingness and ability to repay a loan or propensity to respond to a marketing offer". [Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20201124145234if%5F/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KeycN%5F50ac)
    -   A 2011 [Swiss study](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5959587) showed that a similar set of smartphone metadata could be used to predict personality traits with an accuracy up to 75.9%.

    -   Equifax offers [numerous](https://www.equifax.com/business/customer-targeting-and-scoring/) consumer scoring services. These include:
        -   **[Affluence Index](https://www.equifax.com/business/affluence-index/):** "a continuous household-based score of 1 to 1000 that ranks households by their estimated capacity to spend, save, or invest."

        -   **[WealthComplete](https://www.equifax.com/business/wealthcomplete/):** "provides estimates of total assets at the household level, based on the estimated total liquid financial assets held by all U.S. households."


### Advertising {#advertising}

Moat Analytics, a subdivision of Oracle, provides, among other services, services to measure and improve "consumer attention". In their [marketing brochure](https://web.archive.org/web/20210611205501/https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/dc/em/mktg-7203-gbav-step-by-step-guide-v3c.pdf), they describe some of the ad metrics that they can measure:

In-View Time
: the duration that the user keeps the ad visible.

Touch Rate
: on mobile, whether or not your finger touches the ad, regardless of whether or not you click.

% of Video Played In-View
: what percentage of the video you watched while the frame was in view.
    -   Their purported goal is to reduce "wasted" ad spending. They have a [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VIJv1WwH%5FM) where the show off some of their capabilities.

    -   They have partnered with TVision Insights, the "leader in eyes on screen attention measurement."
        -   From their landing page <https://www.tvisioninsights.com/resources/mit-profile>:
            -   "Their computation software can be easily integrated into the graphic processing unit of any web camera. Once installed, their AI technique tracks how many people are watching, their attention level, even their emotions, all in real time."

            -   Trusted by: "FOX, Roku, hulu, Google, Microsoft, AMC NETWORKS."

            -   A competitor, Samba TV, offers a chip to manufacturers that they can embed in their devices. According to a Forbes [expose](https://www.forbes.com/sites/martyswant/2020/03/27/as-connected-tv-use-skyrockets-samba-tv-sees-massive-growth/), "For consumers who buy TVs with Samba TV's technology, it's a show-discovery platform that recommends programs based on their previous choices. For media companies, Samba lets them track exactly what viewers are watching, and who that audience is, at a second-by-second-rate."

            -   Facebook allows advertisers to exclude specific groups of "Ethnic Affinities". In an investigation, [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-lets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race) was able to place an ad for housing that excluded those of African American, Asian America, or Hispanic descent.


### Employment {#employment}

As of 2017, [71 %](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/human-capital-trends/2017/people-analytics-in-hr.html..html) of companies rate _people analytics_ — the use of algorithms in hiring and compensation decisions—as "highly important".

Often, they pay companies like [Cornerstone](https://www.cornerstoneondemand.com/) to score potential candidates. For example, candidates may be scored more favourably if they use certain browsers (Chrome/Firefox over Safari/Edge) and have lower commute times. <sup id="cf5cf049e4e7fb960369aa2aa48129a2"><a href="#adler-bellDataficationEmployment" title="">adler-bellDataficationEmployment</a></sup> While trends like these may be broadly true, they unintentionally discriminate those who must use the default browsers on library computers or who cannot afford to live near urban centres, for example.

The excellent paper _The Datafication of Employment_ puts it eloquently: "Those identified as financially desperate receive ads for predatory loan products and for-profit colleges, while those identified as affluent are targeted for high-paying jobs and low-interest banking products."  <sup id="cf5cf049e4e7fb960369aa2aa48129a2"><a href="#adler-bellDataficationEmployment" title="">adler-bellDataficationEmployment</a></sup>

The keyword here is _predatory_. The collection of our data enables companies to extract the maximum profit from us with a complete disregard for equality of opportunity. What's more, this system is bifurcated—those treated a certain way are oblivious to the treatment of others.

-   A 2015 [study](https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2015/july/online-ads-research.html) Carnegie Mellon University found that Google was significantly more likely to show ads for high-paying jobs to men than to women.


## US Government {#us-government}

-   In 2020 it was revealed that the Department of Homeland Security had purchased a commercial database of location data which tracks the realtime location of millions of American cellphones ([source](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-agencies-use-cellphone-location-data-for-immigration-enforcement-11581078600)). Because this data is commercially available, they do not need a warrant.

-   Branches of the U.S. military, including a unit responsible for international [drone strikes](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3g97x/location-data-apps-drone-strikes-iowa-national-guard), have regularly purchased similar datasets, including data from [Muslim prayer apps](https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x).

-   The governments of many countries collect extremely sensitive data from citizens including those not suspected of any crime. For example, the British OPTICNERVE program, leaked by [Edward Snowden]({{<relref "edward_snowden.md" >}}) in 2013, covertly took pictures of Yahoo messenger users through their webcams every 5 minutes. In a six-month period, images of 1.8 million distinct users were collected.


## Foreign governments {#foreign-governments}

Foreign governments incite polarization using ads, for example by [promoting both pro-Islam and anti-Islam protests](https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-trolls-senate-intelligence-committee-hearing-2017-11?r=US&IR=T) in the same place at the same time.
