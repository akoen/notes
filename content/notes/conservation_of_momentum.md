The conceptualization of the conservation of momentum marked the transition from pre-modern to modern physics.


Because momentum is a vector, and not a scalar like [§Energy]({{< relref "energy" >}}),  it is easier to observe experimentally.
    -   For example, in an inelastic collision, momentum is conserved but kinetic energy is not.
