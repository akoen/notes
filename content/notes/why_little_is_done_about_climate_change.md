In 205, only 0.2% of the US's GDP was invested in renewable energy ([source](https://ourworldindata.org/energy#investment-in-renewable-technologies)). Why?

-   The market always does what is cheap and simple.

-   We would collectively be better off if we took the necessary measures to fight [Climate Change]({{<relref "climate_change.md" >}}), but for each CEO, politician, and lobbyist with the power to make the change, _they_ are better off if they maintain the status quo.
    -   This is the same reason we struggle with [Consistency]({{<relref "consistency.md" >}}). Whenever we are faced with the choice of whether of whether or not to skip the gym in favour of studying, it is most likely a better immediate choice to do so. However, like with climate change, we need to force ourselves to take immediate action in favour of our collective wellbeing.
