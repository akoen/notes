-   We would collectively be better off if we took the necessary measures to fight [§Climate Change]({{< relref "climate_change" >}}), but for each CEO, politician, and lobbyist with the power to make the change, _they_ are better off if they maintain the status quo.
    -   This is the same reason we struggle with [§Consistency]({{< relref "consistency" >}}). Whenever we are faced with the choice of whether of whether or not to skip the gym in favour of studying, it is most likely a better immediate choice to do so. However, like with climate change, we need to force ourselves to take immediate action in favour of our collective wellbeing.
