Instant runoff voting, also known as ranked-choice voting is a [Voting System]({{<relref "voting_systems.md" >}}) where voters rank their candidates in order of preference. It works as following:

-   Voters rank each candidate in order of preference
-   Votes are counted according to each voter's #1 choice.
-   Those who voted for the least popular candidate have their votes redistributing to their #2 choice.

This procedure is repeated until a candidate reaches 50% of the votes and wins. This combats [Plurality Voting]({{<relref "plurality_voting.md" >}})'s vote splitting flaw.
