The Small Web is a term coined by [Aral Balkan](https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/) to describe an internet ideology in which individuals own their own personal spaces online.

Currently, our personal spaces are rented from companies—companies like Google and Facebook who carefully curate our online interactions.

By renting from these corporations, we give up [Privacy]({{<relref "digital_privacy.md" >}}) and freedom of expression.

The Small Web is decentralized: as it grows, no one person or enterprise grows with it.

The main barrier to adoption of a Small Web ideology is the difficulty of setup and maintenance. Currently, there are no easy ways for those with limited experience with technology to operate their own server.
