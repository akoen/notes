#+title:Why Little is Done About Climate Change

In 205, only 0.2% of the US's GDP was invested in renewable energy ([[https://ourworldindata.org/energy#investment-in-renewable-technologies][source]]). Why? 

- The market always does what is cheap and simple.

- We would collectively be better off if we took the necessary measures to fight [[id:5736cee7-7a57-42b1-a81c-341ea54c011d][Climate Change]], but for each CEO, politician, and lobbyist with the power to make the change, /they/ are better off if they maintain the status quo.
  - This is the same reason we struggle with [[id:7c616579-0c7c-4436-9781-4f408738d161][Consistency]]. Whenever we are faced with the choice of whether of whether or not to skip the gym in favour of studying, it is most likely a better immediate choice to do so. However, like with climate change, we need to force ourselves to take immediate action in favour of our collective wellbeing.
