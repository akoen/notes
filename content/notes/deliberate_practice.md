-   It is often assumed that improvement takes place naturally as a result of repetition. This is not true.
-   Repetition leads to stagnation and eventual decline.
-   To effectively improve, one must incorporate the principles of deliberate practice.


## Deliberate practice vs purposeful practice. {#deliberate-practice-vs-purposeful-practice-dot}

Technically, according to the author's of [§Peak]({{< relref "Peak" >}}), there is a distinction between purposeful practice and deliberate practice.

Purposeful practice:

1.  Has well-defined, specific goals.
2.  Is focused.
3.  Involves feedback.
4.  Gets you out of your comfort zone.

While deliberate practice, expanding on top of purposeful practice:

1.  Develops skills that have _already_ been mastered by experts and for which effective training techniques have already been developed.
2.  Incorporates expert instructors to guide a student's practice and provide effective feedback.

However, popular culture has made the two effectively synonymous.


## Learning difficult material {#learning-difficult-material}

[David R. MacIver](https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/) proposes a framework for quickly learning challenging concepts:

1.  Find an easy version of whatever you find hard.
2.  Modify the easy version so that it is as hard as the challenging thing in _exactly_ one way.
3.  Practice the modified version until it is easy.
4.  Repeat this process until the hard thing becomes easy.

While this framework is simple, it identifies a key point: the importance of tight [§Feedback Loops]({{< relref "feedback_loops" >}}).

-   When you learn, don't focus on getting it right. Instead, focus on _how_ you're performing. Then, target the _specific areas_ where you're performing poorly.
