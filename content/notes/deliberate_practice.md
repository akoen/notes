**Practice that is performed simply through repetition leads to stagnation and eventual decline.**

Purposeful practice:

1.  Has well-defined, specific goals.
2.  Is focused.
3.  Involves feedback.
4.  Gets you out of your comfort zone.

Deliberate practice expands upon purposeful practice and:

1.  Develops skills that have _already_ been mastered by experts and for which effective training techniques have already been developed.
2.  Incorporates expert instructors to guide a student's practice and provide effective feedback.

However, popular culture has made the two effectively synonymous.
