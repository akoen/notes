#+title: Small Web

The Small Web is a term coined by [[https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/][Aral Balkan]] to describe an internet ideology in which individuals own their own personal spaces online.

Currently, our personal spaces are rented from companiesâ€”companies like Google and Facebook who carefully curate our online interactions.

By renting from these corporations, we give up [[id:690198da-5662-4141-a601-f93229f90675][Privacy]] and freedom of expression.

The Small Web is decentralized: as it grows, no one person or enterprise grows with it.

The main barrier to adoption of a Small Web ideology is the difficulty of setup and maintenance. Currently, there are no easy ways for those with limited experience with technology to operate their own server.
