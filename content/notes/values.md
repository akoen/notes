According to [Naval Ravikant]({{<relref "naval_ravikant.md" >}}), values are behaviours or habits of yours that you are not willing to compromise on.

> “Foundational values to me are things that I’ve looked at very, very carefully about myself and I’ve deliberately chosen and said, “You know what, this is a habit. This is a way of life. I’m not going to compromise on it. I’m going to stay this way forever. I don’t want to live life any other way.”
