-   In his [article](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html) on [§Tesla]({{< relref "tesla" >}}), [§Tim Urban]({{< relref "tim_urban" >}}) compares knowledge to a tree: if you don't have a solid trunk of information on which to scaffold new ideas, the "branches" will fall down.
    -   This is echoed by [§Michael Nielsen]({{< relref "michael_nielsen" >}}) in [§Article: Augmenting Long-term Memory]({{< relref "augmenting-long-term-memory" >}}) who claims that people need to spend more time focusing on the basic before worrying about complex issues.

-   This way of thinking is shared by many successful entrepreneurs such as [§Elon Musk]({{< relref "elon_musk" >}}) and [§Steve Jobs]({{< relref "steve_jobs" >}})
    -   **When Jobs was designing the iPhone, he asked "What should a mobile phone be?" instead of "How do we make a better blackberry."**

> “My somewhat pious belief was that if people focused more on remembering the basics, and worried less about the “difficult” high-level issues, they'd find the high-level issues took care of themselves. ”
