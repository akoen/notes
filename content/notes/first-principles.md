-   In his [article](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html) on [Tesla]({{<relref "tesla.md" >}}), [Tim Urban]({{<relref "tim_urban.md" >}}) compares knowledge to a tree: if you don't have a solid trunk of information on which to scaffold new ideas, the "branches" will fall down.
    -   This is echoed by [Michael Nielsen]({{<relref "michael_nielsen.md" >}}) in [Article: Augmenting Long-term Memory]({{<relref "augmenting-long-term-memory.md" >}}) who claims that people need to spend more time focusing on the basic before worrying about complex issues.

-   This way of thinking is shared by many successful entrepreneurs such as [Elon Musk]({{<relref "elon_musk.md" >}}) and [Steve Jobs]({{<relref "steve_jobs.md" >}})
    -   **When Jobs was designing the iPhone, he asked "What should a mobile phone be?" instead of "How do we make a better blackberry."**

> “My somewhat pious belief was that if people focused more on remembering the basics, and worried less about the “difficult” high-level issues, they'd find the high-level issues took care of themselves. ”
