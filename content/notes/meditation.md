Meditation is the practice of examining the inner workings of the mind acknowledging that we are not the source of thought, but the one who listens to the turbulence of the mind.

-   The reason meditation is hard and often frustrating is because you can't apply [§§Deliberate Practice]({{< relref "deliberate_practice" >}}): you can't watch anyone else do it and there's no way to tell if you're doing it right. For this reason, people often give up.
